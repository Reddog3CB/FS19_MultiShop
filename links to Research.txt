Hi @Reddog | Fen Farms Ltd
[12:45]
what you are doing is not going to work
[12:45]
if an item is not in the store(manager), it cannot exist on the map / in the save
[12:45]
so removing items from there is not likely to yield the results you want to have
[12:45]
What I think you want to do is instead filter the content in the UI side of things

riiiigght. That would be....suboptimal.

Let me quickly grab the fs19 code
[12:47]
So if this is builtin to a map, it is best to be as safe as possible and limit any changes you make.
[12:48]
You'll want to focus on the ShopCOntroller class which is only used for the shop
[12:49]
local brandItems = self.shopController:getItemsByBrand(brandId) is used to get items of a brand, local categoryItems = self.shopController:getItemsByCategory(categoryName) is used to get items of a category.
[12:49]
If you also want to hide empty brands and empty categories... thats a bit harder as it was never designed to do this 
[12:49]
So... best not to try that actually. You might have a NH brand with no vehicles in it because you're near a JD dealer

OK. thanks. I'm guessing that shop search mod is the place to start then as I believe they are using shopController

Rahkiin | Chillfurrow Farm — Yesterday at 12:52
ShopController.getItemsByBrand = Utils.overwrittenFunction(ShopController.getItemsByBrand, function(controller, superFunc, brandId)
     local items = superFunc(controller, brandId)
     -- here, remove items from the list that you dont want shown. Each item is a ShopDisplayItem. You want to focus on its .storeItem property, which is a StoreItem. This in turns contains stuff like 'xmlFilename', 'brandIndex', and 'species'
     return items
end)
[12:53]
Same thing for ShopController:getItemsByCategory(categoryName) adjust accordingly
[12:54]
using e.g. if #items > 0 then table.remove(items, 1) end would remove the first item of all pages

OK, thanks a bunch. I'll have a play about with it. I've looked again the shop search mod and they are using the same functionality, but obviously adding in the GUI element. I'll see where I get to.,

if this is a map, the lines of code above is all you really need to get the filtering going
[13:03]
to get player position, local x, y, z = getWorldTranslation(g_currentMission.player.rootNode).(edited)
